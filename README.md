## For Developers

### Clone Website Steps
**Note: If you don't know how to do a git clone properly follow the following steps:*
- Open File Explorer
- Choose main folder where you want to install the project in *(The Installation will add a folder by itself)*
- Click the 'search bar' on top *(e.g. The bar says `Desktop > Coding`)*
---
Once you're in the terminal (CMD), follow these steps:

**If you dont have bun installed, please do that before running `bun i`.*
1. run in bash `git clone https://github.com/CodeWithAli-Co/CodeWithAli.git`
2. `bun i`
3. `bun run dev`
   


And that's it! Your app should be up and running. If you're having any trouble with getting the project on your device, please contact Ali or an Admin in the Discord Server.
